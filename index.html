          <p>Hi, My name is Gustav Bergman and I am currently studying to become a Front-end developer. Welcome to my online portfolio! This portfolio is a part of the first individual project assignment but it's something i will keep working on over time as the course continue.
          Here you'll be able to read a little about me, what i do, what i've studied previously and the courses i've taken. But also to view previous work. On top of that you'll find some info about me personally. What i like to do on my spare time, hobbies, interests, you name it.

          The purpose of this website is also to provide a way for me to showcase what i can do and what i learned so far through out the education while i simultaneously work toward learning new things and improving upon the base knowledge i already possess. Which i then can implement to the website in the future.</p>

          <p>Here are a few (Keyword being "few") of my previous projects. One project from a previous webdeveloper course and one project from a "Graphic design" course. I don't have much to show yet unfortunately due to issues i had with the computer i used at the time. Almost all of the data, projects and workfiles were lost. But hopefully i can fill this gallery up over time and improve on its design to better fit a larger quantity of projects.</p>
          <p>Without further ado, let's get into the projects!</p>
          <!-- First Project, Webbdeveloper Course. -->
          <h3>Project 1: Webdeveloper course, End project.</h3>
          <img class="gallery-image" src="img/project-1.png" alt="">
          <p class="info-text">Warning: This is not the actual project, the original screenshots of the finished work were lost due to PC issues i had at the time.</p>
          <p> This was the big main project we had in the end of our "Webdevelopment" course. We had the task to create a website using html, css, php, Mysql (database) and JQuery/Javascript. For me personally it was very similar to this project since i decided to make a portfolio/online resume.</p>
          <p>I went with a pretty standard and simple design with a navbar in the top with links to my portfolio gallery, about me, contact info etc. Then i had a slider on the index page which featured images from diffrent projects in the portfolio as "banner". then i had a centered "main" div which featured the main content on the side and last but not least, a full width footer at the bottom of the page.</p>
          <p>To specify some features i had which doesnt show on the image i had a admin page with a upload form where i could upload projects. The form consisted of 4 fields where i filled in the preview image and text as well as the full image and text if you clicked on a specific projekt. The upload form validated file size, type, image proportions, text etc.</p>
          <p> The project was finished and hosted live in 2014 fully validated without errors in Html and CSS.</p>
          <!-- Second Project, Digital Creations Course. -->
          <h3>Project 2: Digital Creations course, Major project.</h3>
          <img class="gallery-image" src="img/project-2.png" alt="">
          <p class="info-text">The "Locus" helmet from the video game "Halo 4" drawn and colored in Photoshop. Copyright ©</p>
          <p>This was the biggest project i made during my digital creations course. We were assigned to draw a image and color it in Photoshop. I choose to combine this project with my Webdeveloper project and made the images that was going to be featured in my slider/project gallery on my online portfolio. I Choose to draw a helmet featured in the game "Halo 4" called the "Locus" helmet. I used a reference image to help draw the contures of the helmet and the position of some of the details.</p>
          <p>Appart from making some of the outlines/contures with a reference image i manually colored, shaded and highlighted the image by "hand" using photoshop. The project took a really long time, manily due to the fact i learned alot of new techniques along the way which i implemented in the image. I would guess the image, from start to finish took about 3-4 months.</p>
